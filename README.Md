Python Simulation Projects

This repository contains two Python-based simulation projects developed to demonstrate fundamental concepts in simulation, modeling, and algorithmic decision-making:

Robot Vacuum Cleaner Simulation
Money Model Simulation
Both projects focus on applying logical rules and state-based behavior to represent real-world systems.

Robot Vacuum Cleaner Simulation
Overview

The Robot Vacuum Cleaner Simulation models an autonomous cleaning agent operating within a two-dimensional environment. The robot navigates the environment, identifies dirty locations, and cleans them according to predefined movement and decision rules.

The project demonstrates basic artificial intelligence concepts such as agent behavior, environment perception, and rule-based decision making.

Objectives

Simulate autonomous movement in a defined environment
Model cleaning behavior based on environmental state
Demonstrate agent–environment interaction
Apply logical decision-making using Python
Features

Grid-based environment representation
Dirty and clean cell states
Autonomous robot movement (up, down, left, right)
Cleaning action when dirt is detected
Simulation step tracking via console output
Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 3
Libraries: Standard Python libraries only
How the Simulation Works

The environment is initialized as a grid with randomly or manually assigned dirty cells.

The robot starts at a defined position within the grid.

At each step, the robot:

Senses the current cell
Cleans the cell if it is dirty
Moves to a neighboring cell based on defined rules
The simulation continues until all cells are clean or a stopping condition is reached.

Example Use Case

This simulation can be used to demonstrate:

Basic AI agent logic
Simulation design in Python
Introductory concepts in autonomous systems
Money Model Simulation
Overview

The Money Model Simulation represents a simplified financial system that tracks the flow of money over time. It simulates income, expenses, and balance updates to model basic economic behavior.

This project is useful for understanding financial modeling and state management in Python.

Objectives

Simulate income and expense transactions
Track balance changes over time
Model financial behavior using Python
Maintain accurate transaction records
Features

Initial balance configuration
Income and expense transactions
Automatic balance updates
Transaction history tracking
Console-based financial summaries
Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 3
Data Handling: Python variables and data structures
Optional File Handling: Text or CSV files
How the Simulation Works

The simulation begins with an initial balance.
Income transactions increase the balance.
Expense transactions decrease the balance.
Each transaction is recorded with relevant details.
The system outputs updated balances and summaries.
Example Use Case

This simulation can be used for:

Learning financial modeling basics
Practicing data handling in Python
Understanding transaction-based systems
